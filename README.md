# Rainy NFT Collection (RNY)

### Contract Address (Sepolia Testnet): *To be deployed* 

## Description

* Rainy NFT Collection (RNY) is an exclusive ERC-721A token collection featuring pixelated images generated by AI tools like DALLE 2 or Midjourney. Each NFT in this collection represents a unique scene captured during rainy weather, showcasing various locations from around the world. These NFTs are not only visually appealing but also come with a description of the prompt used to generate them, adding an extra layer of uniqueness.

## Features

* **Unique Art**: Each NFT in the collection is a pixelated image generated using advanced AI tools, ensuring one-of-a-kind artwork.

* **Prompt Description**: The contract includes a function to return the prompt used to generate each image, providing context and background for each piece of art.

* **Polygon Integration**: To save on gas fees and increase accessibility, the collection is mapped to the Polygon network via the Polygon Bridge.

* **IPFS Storage**: All images are stored securely on IPFS, ensuring they are decentralized and easily accessible.

## FxPortal

* **FxPortal**: FxPortal is a bridging mechanism that allows assets to be transferred between the Ethereum and Polygon networks. It enables seamless movement of NFTs and other assets across the two chains, leveraging Polygon's lower gas fees and faster transaction times. By using FxPortal, the Rainy NFT Collection can ensure accessibility and affordability for a wider audience.
